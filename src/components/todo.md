# TODOs

make buttons a sticky footer? to avoid vertical jump when activity changes

when user presses OK and starts an activity:
save current time to localstore
run a timer from then til now
offer a button to 'stop doing'
if pressed, becomes 1 button becomes two: 'do more' and 'im done'
if do more, run a timer and repeat
if im done, i log this as a done activity

after X nah's => give option to input custom activity
some absolute-floaty button can sneak in to suggest it
